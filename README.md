# Unofficial FreeBSD Foundation Intern Guide

This is the FreeBSD intern guide of the interns, by the interns and for the interns. Feel free to contribute as little as we want and there is no pressure at all.

This repo is constructed and synced with Gitbook. Chapters are plain Markdown files and can be edited without Gitbook if the structure is not changed. The preview is available here:   https://yzgyyang.gitbooks.io/unofficial-freebsd-foundation-intern-guide/content/
